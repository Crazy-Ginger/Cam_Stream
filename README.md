# Camera_Stream
A bash bash script that streams a given camera to twitch
1 Argument: stream key passed afer running the command

Defaults to /dev/video0 as input device (change accordingly)

Uses ffmpeg to stream the video

(I've removed most audio options, add them back accordingly)

This script is taken from [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Streaming_to_twitch.tv#Shell_script_method) and modified for my use
